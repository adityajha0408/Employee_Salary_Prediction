# 🧠 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based solution to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year based on census data. It leverages classification algorithms to build a predictive model from the *Adult Income Dataset (UCI Repository)*.

## 📌 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to predict whether a person earns more than 50K annually using features such as age, education, occupation, hours worked per week, etc. This helps in analyzing income patterns and assists organizations in candidate profiling and decision-making.
